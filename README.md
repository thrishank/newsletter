# Rust Server

A Email newsletter server in rust

## Features

- CI Pipeline
  - code testing
  - code formatting
  - code linting
- CD pipeline
  - build the docker image
  - Push the docker images to the registry
  - ssh into the server securely and run the deploy script
- API Routes
  - /health_check api to check if the server is running returns nothing takes nothing
  - /subscriptions api to add a new subscription, body: email and name add's into the database
- Tests
  - health_check test to check if the server is running. check if returns 200 OK
  - subscriptions test with valid data checks if the data is added to the database and invalid data checks if the response is 400

## Notes

- Implemented the CI pipeline on github with 3 jobs(cargo test, cargo fmt -- check, cargo clippy -- -D warnings)
- Implemented the /health_check api route returns 200 OK
- Made the port on which server runs dyanmic. This is done by starting a server on port 0. This is telling the OS to pick free port from its ephemeral port range (e.g., 49152â€“65535 on most systems). This way we can spwan as many server as we want and avoid conflicts in tests

## TODO

- Database is starting and migrations is successfull but POST request is failing. Need to debug the issue
- cargo clippy is failing with some warnings. Need to fix them
